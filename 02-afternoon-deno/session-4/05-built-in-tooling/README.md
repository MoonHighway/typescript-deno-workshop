Discover how Deno simplifies project setup compared to Node.js by eliminating the need for third-party dependencies. We demonstrate Deno's automatic code formatting with 'deno fmt', code analysis with 'deno lint', and testing capabilities using 'deno test'. Explore how to run these tools on entire directories or individual files, manage linting rules, and check code coverage with no need to set anything up.

### Run the Formatter:

```bash
deno fmt
```

### Run the Linter:

```bash
deno lint
```

### Run Tests:

```bash
deno test
```
