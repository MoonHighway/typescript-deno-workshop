ðŸŽ¥ [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8DaWZq6TXk&list=PLvvLnBDNuTEov9EBIp3MMfHlBxaKGRWTe&index=4&pp=iAQB)

Deno prioritizes security by default, requiring developers to explicitly opt-in for accessing sensitive information like file systems and networks. We demonstrate building a simple web server using the deno.serve function in server.ts, showcasing how Deno asks for permissions to use network resources. The video also highlights how Deno's permission system is similar to browsers, promoting secure app runtime by controlling access to APIs. Learn how to manage permissions efficiently in your Deno applications.
